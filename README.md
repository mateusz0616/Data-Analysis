   * 🛠️ Technologies used: ** Python,Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Datetime, Regular Expressions (re)**
   * 🪜 Basic steps of data processing.
       - Loading data using.
       - Primary analysis  to view the data structure.
       - Data cleanup:
         - Removing or replacing missing values.
         - Bringing data to the desired formats (e.g., dates).
         - Cleaning text data using regular expressions.
       - Analyzing data using visualizations (matplotlib).
       - Final preparation of data for further analysis or use in a model.
    * 🧠 This project showcases my ability to:
        - Work with real-world, messy data and turn it into something meaningful.
        - Apply advanced cleaning techniques to solve complex data problems.
        - Use data visualization to validate and communicate insights.
        - Prepare data for downstream tasks like analysis, reporting, or machine learning.
